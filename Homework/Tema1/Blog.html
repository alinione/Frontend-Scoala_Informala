    <h3>Rules for Autocomplete</h3>
    <em>Posted on March 19, 2019</em>
    <p>
      Autocompleting text with known values seems like an easy problem to solve,
      but so so so many UIs get it wrong. I see this frequently enough that,
      rather than complain about them individually, I though I'd just write down
      the set of rules they often break.
